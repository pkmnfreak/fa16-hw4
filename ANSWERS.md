5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

The walkthrough and links to the documents were really helpful. I did not remember much from this lecture's demo because it was all over the place so without those resources I would have been completely lost. Other than that, it was cool combining everything we've learned until now into one hw and I'm surprised at how much I remember from previous lectures. This is super cool.
